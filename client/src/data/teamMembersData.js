        title: 'Biography of Zoe Rich Dennis Nguni',
        content: `Zoe Rich Dennis Nguni is a devoted Christian leader, humanitarian visionary, and entrepreneur, born and raised in a Christian home that laid the foundation for his life of purpose, faith, and service. At the age of 14, Zoe made a personal decision to follow Jesus Christ — a turning point that ignited a lifelong journey of spiritual growth and leadership.

In September 2008, Zoe joined Christ Embassy (Believers’ LoveWorld Inc.), where he found deeper purpose under the dynamic teachings of Pastor Chris Oyakhilome DSc., DD. His passion for ministry and excellence in service led to his appointment as Church Coordinator for Christ Embassy Kabwe in Central Province in 2010. Demonstrating exceptional leadership, he was later assigned to Mazabuka in 2013, where he faithfully served until 2021, fostering the ministry’s growth through evangelism, discipleship, and leadership development.

Beyond his spiritual calling, Zoe is a visionary entrepreneur and social reformer. He is the Chief Executive Officer of both Phalluw Hygiene and Katalambano Limited, enterprises driven by a commitment to health, innovation, and economic empowerment. His heart for humanity is most profoundly expressed through his work as Founder and President of We Are The World, a humanitarian organization headquartered in Zambia. Under his leadership, the organization is delivering transformational impact through several flagship initiatives.`,
